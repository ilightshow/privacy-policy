## What data do we collect, why and how do we collect it?

If you use iLightShow™ with Spotify Connect, we automatically log you in iLightShow™ using the Spotify authentication service. After this step, your Spotify ID will be used to identify your iLightShow™ account. 

This ID is stored in the server error logs for a few days (only if errors occur).

### IP address / Country
Each time you use iLightShow™, the app contacts our servers. Each connection is logged to protect and debug the service (eg. protect the service against DDoS attacks).

This data is stored directly on the server(s) for a few days. In case of a service abuse from one of your IP address, your IP address will be sent to Cloudflare, which will block you IP address for a short period of time.
